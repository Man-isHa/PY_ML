# PY_ML

Started with the understanding of the perceptron model, linear regression
Basic and simple implementation of :- 
polynomial fitting 
linear regression
Rosenblatt's perceptron learning
AND , XOR function

NEURAL NETWORKS
Tensorflow and Theano implementaion for simple neural network architecture with varying hidden layers
Autoencoders from scratch in MATLAB and Python

Predictive Analysis
Randomforest Classifier on Kaggle Titanic  dataset and Cancer Dataset

Image Captioning
Theano and Tensorflow as well as Keras implementation of Captioning of images for Flickr30K dataset

Energy Based Models
Hopfield nets without any hidden layers for pattern remembering and generating pattern when pixels are flipped
Training of RBM using the Wake and Sleep learning Algorithm

Upcoming (Generative models)....
GANs VAEs and GAN+VAE
